**Title: Data Visualization on Honey Production dataset using seaborn
and matplotlib libraries.**

**Domain: Food and agriculture**

**Objective:**
In 2006, a global concern was raised over the rapid decline in the honeybee population, an integral component
to American honey agriculture. Large numbers of hives were lost to “Colony-Collapse-Disorder”, a
phenomenon of disappearing “worker-bees” causing the remaining “hive-colony” to collapse. Speculation
around the cause of this disorder points to hive-diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, though no
overall consensus has been reached. Twelve years later, some industries are observing recovery but the
American honey industry is still largely struggling. The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it
consumes per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400 million pounds of honey
consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and
demand in America by state from 1998 to 2012.

**Action:**
Employed Python visualization libraries Seaborn and Matplotlib to analyze honey production data of America from 1998 to 2012, aiming to understand supply and demand dynamics across states.

**Result:**
•	Utilized visualization techniques to extract state wise trends, patterns, and potential factors impacting honey production. 
•	Identified a robust positive correlation between total production and all attributes in the dataset, indicating significant interdependency within the American honey industry.
